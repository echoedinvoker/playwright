## **folder 'test-results'**

- We can pull trace.zip directly from here to trace.playwright.dev, which should save time when we need to repeat this operation.

## **Only generate trace when failed result**

> Because tracing takes a lot of pictures and records, it will increase the memory used for testing, so the following settings are recommended.
